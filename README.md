# Appendages

## *Active*
Active appendages are those which are triggered with the `prefix`
	

    AudioPlay			Scans message and follows the link supplied. 
					If the link is an audio file, it will join 
					the voice channel the sender is currently in and start playing.
	HardMute (WIP)
	HardUnmute (WIP)
	Guildinfo			Prints non-invasive information about the current guild.


## *Passive*
Passive appendages are those which apply to every message received. These are generally monitoring tools.

    Toxicity-Checker		Sends the message for analysis via PerspectiveAPI, returns a score.
